# MultiPagePDF_Resizer
A python based multi-page PDF resizer using PyPDF2

REQUIRES: PyPDF2 (dependency)

This PDF resizer is built specifically to resize a multipage (less than 3 pages) PDF into Tabloid (11x17) or Letter (8.5x11) sizes
for our unique workflow.  However, with a little tweaking it can resize multiple page documents to your hearts' content.

Again, big thanks to Paul Rooney (https://stackoverflow.com/users/1540468/paul-rooney) for his insightful responses on StackOverflow
in reference to PyPDF2 issues I was having.
